# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors and users.

## Our Standards

- Be respectful, inclusive, and considerate.
- Use constructive language; focus on the code and ideas.
- Accept feedback gracefully; disagree respectfully.
- Help others learn; share context and rationale.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct.
- Personal attacks, insults, or trolling.
- Sharing private information without consent.
- Disruptive, intentionally unproductive behavior.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces: issues, PRs, discussions, and any public or private communications related to the project.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Prefer private contact to the maintainer: <REPLACE_WITH_CONTACT_EMAIL>.
- If email isn’t practical, open a minimal public issue titled “Code of Conduct report” without sensitive details; a maintainer will follow up privately.

## Enforcement

- Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate: warnings, temporary or permanent bans from interactions, or other measures.
- Decisions are made with respect for the community and based on available information.

## Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open‑source community norms, including the Contributor Covenant.
